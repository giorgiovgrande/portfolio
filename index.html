   <h3>Fashioning a Coder</h3>

    <p>New to coding, I am an experienced writer with a specialism in creative content and copy. I am also a keen editor and having previously applied my analytical 
        eye to the written word, I am now learning to do so with code. Therefore, I am learning a breadth of programming languages in order 
        to fully compliment my profesional skill-set. I am doing so at Code Nation, Manchester, before embarking on a career as a QA Analyst, 
        working with MPP Global.

     A little about my background: perhaps unusual for a prospective developer; 
            I have foundations in the fashion industry, working as a writer for various 
            publications, including 160grams and Voir. I have had the opportunity to work 
            at London Fashion Week, reviewing collections and even interviewing key figures 
            like the esteemed photographer, Rankin. Following this, 
            I also took the opportunity to work as a model, working for brands such as 
            Toni & Guy, Babyliss Pro and Cindy Kihn.

    <p>It is an unusual, but rich foundation, equipping with me with a diversity of sector-knowledge, sharp visual
        intelligence and refined creative skills. These are all traits that I am eager to employ throughout my QA and developer career. I envision that one-day, I 
        will be a talented full-stack developer, yet one who is able to create visually appealing content, while programming complicated code.</p>

    <h3>Code Nation</h3>
    <p>Having worked with HTML when creating web content as a writer, learning to code has represented an opportunity to advance my technical skillset, 
        and through coding, I have been able to apply my logical, interpersonal and creative skills.
